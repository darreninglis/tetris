# Tetris - Vanilla JavaScript Tetris.

## Description

This project was inspired by a previous JavaScript tutorial I found on YouTube. I went a head and added background music, SFX and a nice background image to set the theme.

## Tech Stack

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google web fonts

## What I Learned

This was a great exercise to drill my ES6+ familiarity and play around with Canvas. The real challenge is creating each shape with a Matrix.
